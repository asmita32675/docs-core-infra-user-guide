^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Rackspace Command Line Interface (rack) is a unified tool you can use to manage 
your Rackspace services. 

As opposed to using different clients to perform different tasks, *rack* requires
no additional plugins to allow additional functionality with the Rackspace Cloud.
Rackspace CLI utilizes `gophercloud <http://gophercloud.io/>`__, an Openstack
compatible SDK that allows for complete functionality with most Rackspace services.
